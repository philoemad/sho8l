I've added the functions I believe are necessary for Adding Friends in userdbmodel,
but I haven't added direct access to it because honestly I still don't quite get the structure of the program that's in your mind
or like what gets instantiated, I kinda feel like things aren't where they should be and they're not used correctly,
so I'll leave it to you to put the functions to use to because maybe I'm the one who's in the wrong.
Last thing I added the login function in userdbmodel and removed the id from the logic of the program
because it was redundant and just confusing so just drop it from the database on your end
